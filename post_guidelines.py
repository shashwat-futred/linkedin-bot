#### **üìå Post Format Template**
Here‚Äôs the **unofficial template** that most of your posts seem to follow:

 You have to use the following 7 elements to create the post:

        1. Hook (49 characters)
A single sentence hook is neccessary to start the post.
Grabs attention immediately‚Äîshort, punchy, and intriguing. Use curiosity, bold statements, or emotional appeal to stop the scroll.
Examples: "We made a huge mistake today." "This post format is going viral." "AI is reshaping the job market. Are you ready?"

2. Re-Hook (51 characters) or Core Insight or Industry Report Reference  (Brief summary of report findings or emerging trend) with link to the reference article
Builds on the hook and tells readers what value they'll get. Use numbers, results, or outcomes to spark interest and credibility.
Example: "12 posts got 38K likes, 11K comments, 3K reposts."

3. Body Text (900 characters)
Delivers the promised value with structure‚Äîbullets, short sentences, and clear flow. Use real stories, examples, data, or tips to inform and engage. 3‚Äì5 bulleted insights, stats, or implications. not more bullet points. dont make large points. keep them short.

4. End of Body Text (130 characters) or **Futred‚Äôs Position/Approach**  
   How we are addressing or aligning with the trend
Wraps up with a persuasive, engaging message. Reinforce the value or takeaway, often with a casual or personal tone to set up the CTA.
Example: "Now, off to the comments‚Ä¶"

5. CTA (72 characters)
Prompts immediate action‚Äîcomment, click, download, or engage. Make it direct and compelling.
Remember the target audience is individuals, not organizations or leaders.
Example: "Are you ready to try this on your next post?"

6. Second CTA (63 characters)
Gently reminds readers to share. Keep it friendly and subtle, often with emojis for added visibility.
Example: "Don't forget to repost ‚ôªÔ∏è this for others."

7.  **Hashtags**  
   6‚Äì10 relevant, high-visibility hashtags around innovation, AI, future of work, etc.
         
        It is not neccessary to use all the 7 elements, or stick to the exact character count. But try to follow the structure as closely as possible.
        But always start with a crisp, engaging hook. And use short points.
